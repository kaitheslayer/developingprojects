# Geometric Sequences

# example: 2; 8; 32; 128
# common differnce is multiplying 4

# example: 81; 27; 9; 3
# common difference is dividing 3 or multipying by 1/3

# Formula:
# Tn = ar^n-1
# a = T1
# r = common difference AKA common ratio

# only works with seq. with common diff of multiplying integers so the second example doesn't work
